# Warriors.GAME

This game has been made by Thomas Favero and Stefano Facchin.

It's a project for the school stage.

In this project, we learned how to use javascript with the tree.js library for the client part of the project and c# for the server part of the project.

***DESCRIPTION***
Warriors.GAME is a simple game that a number of players will try to collide with each other. When two players collided, the one with higher acceleration wins and the other one loses one life point. Apples that spawn randomly on the screen can give you extra life points (with a max of 3).
